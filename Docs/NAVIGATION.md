## 🚀 Quick Start Paths

### Path 1: Build the Document Q&A System (Recommended)
**Goal:** Working Streamlit web app in 3-5 days

```
1. START_HERE.md (5 min) → Get oriented
2. FOCUSED_USE_CASE.md (10 min) → Understand what you're building
3. STREAMLIT_QUICK_START.md (3-5 days) → Build it step-by-step
4. Done! Working system
```

### Path 2: Understand the Architecture First
**Goal:** Deep technical understanding before building

```
1. START_HERE.md → Overview
2. README.md → Full architecture
3. ARCHITECTURE_AND_MODULARITY.md → Design patterns
4. STREAMLIT_QUICK_START.md → Build it
```

### Path 3: Extend an Existing System
**Goal:** Add new features to a working system

```
1. ARCHITECTURE_AND_MODULARITY.md → How to extend
2. FILE_DEPENDENCIES.md → Build order (if needed)
3. Implement your feature
```
